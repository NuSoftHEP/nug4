///
/// Purpose: This class is "attached" to the G4PrimaryParticle.  It's used to
/// save the MCTruth object associated with the event.
///
/// Background: Read this carefully, because this class probably
/// doesn't do what you think it does.
///
/// Geant4 has various "truth" classes: G4Event, G4Track,
/// G4PrimaryVertex, G4PrimaryParticle, etc.  For all of these
/// classes, Geant4 provides a facility for the user to include
/// additional information that's "attached" to the class in question.
///
/// In this case, this class defines additional information to
/// included with the G4PrimaryParticle class.  In particular, it
/// stores the pointer to the simb::MCTruth object that was the
/// source of the G4PrimaryParticle information.
/// 
/// The reason why this class is necessary for the G4Base application
/// is that it allows the ParticleListAction class access to the
/// MCTruth pointer during Geant4's tracking.
